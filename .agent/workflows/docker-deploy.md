# Multi-stage build for minimal production image

FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package\*.json ./
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -u 1001 -G appgroup
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]

## Docker Rules

- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size.
- Pin base image versions (e.g., \`node:20.11-alpine\`, not \`node:latest\`).
- Run as non-root user. Never run containers as root in production.
- Use \`.dockerignore\` to exclude: \`node_modules\`, \`.git\`, \`.env\`, tests, docs.
- One process per container. Use Docker Compose for multi-service setups.
- Health checks: \`HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1\`.

## Docker Compose Template

\`\`\`yaml
services:
app:
build: .
ports: ["3000:3000"]
env_file: .env
depends_on:
db: { condition: service_healthy }
restart: unless-stopped
db:
image: postgres:16-alpine
volumes: ["pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
environment:
POSTGRES_DB: myapp
POSTGRES_USER: myapp
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
healthcheck:
test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U myapp"]
interval: 5s
timeout: 3s
retries: 5
volumes:
pgdata:
